# VBA_Challenge
 
## Overview
In this project we are using a stock market dataset to run a VBA solution code to loop through all the data and refactor the code to run more faster and be able to handle a larger dataset.

## Results

From the inital starting point I was able to run through the entire dataset and get the outputs for all the data on the 2017 and 2018 stocks. Below you will see the final results with showing the ticker, daily volume, and return for the stocks.

## Summary
A few things of note with refactoring the code was the time investment to just doing a few steps to test before continuing on to do some more changes. And advantage would be being able to go in and write clean code makes it easier in the future to make more changes and for someone to come in an understand what it is trying to do.
